# **Integrity and Respect in Research Practices**
> “Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching.”

A very popular quote, well known to be said by C.S. Lewis. However, interestingly, in his personal website, it is listed as one of the quotes misattributed to his name, and stated that the quote is a paraphrased from Charles Marshall’s book titled Shattering the Glass Slipper. This reflects Lewis’ integrity and respect, not only to the original author, but also to the public. 

In real life, especially as researchers, there will be times when we cannot avoid unintended ethical mistakes. At that times, what matters are our integrity and respect to set things right. The moment when we realize that ethical mistakes were made unintentionally, we have all the responsibilities to fix it as soon as possible, so that no one will bear any further disadvantages. 

All steps of research activities must be done with integrity and respect. The reason why these two things is important in research practices is for us to gain trust as researchers, so that our research can give impact to the society. Not only that, we can be confident to say that our research are carried out in compliance to the ethical guidelines and the results are valid and accurate to our best knowledge. 

## The planning stage

It is important to make sure that the idea is original, and the research is designed according to the ethical principles, proven by IRB and IACUC approval. Especially, when conducting research on human subjects, research must be done with respect, by putting their safety and well-being as priority, and keeping all the entrusted personal information safe. 

## When conducting a research

Moving on to the next stage, the experiment has to be carefully conducted, and data falsification and fabrication must be avoided at all costs. Despite of the pressure to gain academic prestige or financial gain, we have to remember that it all will be meaningless, if we cannot be confident with our research. Also, all unavoidable potential conflict of interest should be publicly disclosed and made sure that it does not affect our research. 

## The publication stage

Integrity and respect to other researchers is needed to avoid plagiarism and unjustified authorship. When writing a publication, we have to cite all the references we refer to in the right manner, and be careful not to claim other researchers’ thoughts as ours. Respect to each other as colleagues is also important to create a healthy research environment, which will surely have good impact on productivity. 

Finally, remembering that integrity is doing the right thing even when no one is watching might be helpful to always maintain our research integrity at all situations. **It does not have to be perfect research, but it has to be research we are confident with, because it has been done with integrity and respect.** That way, we hope that through our research, we can contribute to the improvement to human lives and the world.
